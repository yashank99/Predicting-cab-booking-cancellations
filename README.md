# Predicting-cab-booking-cancellations
Cab booking cancellation prediction for your cabs

**Language:** Python

**Libraries:** Pandas, sklearn

**Environment:** Jupyter Notebook 

Welcome to my Machine Learning project!

This data analytics project focuses on predicting cab booking cancellations using the "YourCabs" dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset provides valuable insights into various factors affecting the cancellation of cab bookings, enabling us to build a predictive model for anticipating cancellations. By leveraging advanced data analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to enhance the efficiency of cab services and improve customer satisfaction.
